## Highlights

<!-- TODO Add news related to embedded Rust that are not about new crates releases here -->

- TODO(remove, this is an example) "const generics" has landed in nightly!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) the Rust compiler has gained cross compilation support for the Xtensa architecture!

## Embedded Projects

<!-- TODO Add news about embedded projects here -->

* [Jens Reimann] has assembled a [docker image] for developing Rust on the ESP8266 and ESP32 series of devices, including stable `alloc` support!

[docker image]: https://github.com/ctron/rust-esp-container/

* [Lucas Brendel] working on peripheral access crates as well as a shared embedded HAL for the Infineon XMC4 series of microcontrollers in the [xmc-rs organization]. Peripheral access crates are available and the HAL is in the very early stages of development.

* [42 Technology] have published the source code for their Nordic [nRF9160 demonstration application], along with a Rust crate which wraps up Nordic's proprietary C driver library. They also have a piece comparing Embedded Rust and Embedded C published in the German language magazine [IOT Design] this month.

* [theJPster]'s [Monotron] got a write-up in [Hackaday]. Moves are also afoot for a next-generation Monotron - codename [Neotron 1000] - complete with a book! Check it out if you're interested developing a modern-day version of CP/M, written in Rust.

[probe-rs] finally has released on crates.io. The library enables you to inspect, debug and flash ARM cores. Flash the ARM core your future embedded Rust project with [cargo-flash], fully integrated into cargo. Flashing works for the **nRF51822, nRF52832, nRF52840, STMF042 and STMF429xI** using a **DAPLink** or an **ST-Link**.
The 0.3.0 release will also enable your to flash any ARM core (provided an an ARM CMSIS-Pack exists in a known registry).
We are looking for contributors that provide a chip algorithm config file for various chips!

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to add it to [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!
